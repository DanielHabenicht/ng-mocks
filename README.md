#NgMocks

The plan is to merge these mock libraries into one but for now is an export of the 3 packages:

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-component)

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-directive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-directive)

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-pipe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-pipe)
